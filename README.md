    <h1>Dry_Bean</h1>
    <p >1 - The aim of this task is to categorize types of beans based on their physical features. It involves 7 classes with 16 features and a dataset containing 13,611 samples. All the features are numerical.</p>
    <p>2 - The labels are encoded using Label Encoder to facilitate processing.</p>
    <p>3 - Outliers are mitigated using transformations instead of deletion due to one of the classes being canceled and the high number of outliers.</p>
    <p>4 - Oversampling techniques are employed to address class imbalance.</p>
    <p>5 - The data is split initially into Train and Test sets, and then further divided into Train, Validation, and Test sets. Additionally, k-fold cross-validation is utilized.</p>
    <p>6 - Various algorithms including Random Forest, Xgboost, and KNN are applied for classification.</p>
